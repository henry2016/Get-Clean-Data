# This R script, "run_analysis.R", was written in September, 2015 by henry2016
# as a programming assignment for an online "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.
#
# According to the assignment's instructions, this script should:
#
# 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create a single data set.
# 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
#    measurement.
# 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
#    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#
#    The training and the test sets are in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.
